# Confidential Information?

[\[State whether your project has confidential information from
industry, or not. If there is confidential information, point to the
agreement you have in place. ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

[\[For most teams this section will just state that there is no
confidential information to protect. ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

# IP to Protect

[\[State whether there is IP to protect. If there is, point to the
agreement. All students who are working on a project that requires an IP
agreement are also required to sign the "Intellectual Property Guide
Acknowledgement." ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

# Copyright License

[\[What copyright license is your team adopting. Point to the license in
your repo. ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

# Team Meeting Plan

[\[How often will you meet? where? ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

[\[If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an
abundance of caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location
online ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

[\[How often will you meet with your industry advisor? when? where?
---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

[\[Will meetings be virtual? At least some meetings should likely be
in-person. ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

[\[How will the meetings be structured? There should be a chair for all
meetings. There should be an agenda for all meetings.

# Team Communication Plan

***Table 2: Communication Plan***
  **Type** | **Method** | 
  -------- | ------------------ | 
  Regular communications  |  Discord  |
  Assignment of tasks  | GitHub Issues |     
  Communications with professors, supervisor, the city, and other stakeholders.   |  Handled by Team Liaison Mitchell Hynes, in-person or over email.|
  Meetings      |     Discord, scheduled through outlook calendar.|
  

# Team Member Roles

[\[You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like
notetaker, leader, meeting chair, reviewer. Assigning specific people to
those roles is not necessary at this stage. In a student team the role
of the individuals will likely change throughout the year.
---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

# Workflow Plan

-   How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?

-   How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
    classification, etc.?

-   Use of CI/CD

# Project Decomposition and Scheduling

-   We will be using Github Projects to decompose our milestones. Each Milestone will be divided
into individual tasks which will then be assigned to different team members.
- Each document will be split into sections, and assigned individually or to groups as needed. 
- The proof of concept, revision 0 and revision 1 will be split feature-wise and assigned to individuals or groups as necessary.
- Time will be alloted for verification, validation and review after the completion of each milestone and before the due date.

# Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project? What
will you demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to
convince yourself that you will be able to overcome this risk?

# Expected Technology

[\[What programming language or languages do you expect to use? What
external libraries? What frameworks? What technologies. Are there major
components of the implementation that you expect you will implement,
despite the existence of libraries that provide the required
functionality. For projects with machine learning, will you use
pre-trained models, or be training your own model?
---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

[\[The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the
course of the project. The initial documentation should be written in an
abstract way; it should be agnostic of the implementation choices,
unless the implementation choices are project constraints. However,
recording our initial thoughts on implementation helps understand the
challenge level and feasibility of a project. It may also help with
early identification of areas where project members will need to augment
their training. ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

Topics to discuss include the following:

-   Specific programming language

-   Specific libraries

-   Pre-trained models

-   Specific linter tool (if appropriate)

-   Specific unit testing framework

-   Investigation of code coverage measuring tools

-   Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation
    that CI is not being done

-   Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if appropriate

-   Tools you will likely be using?

[\[git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.

# Coding Standard

[\[What coding standard will you adopt? ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

# Appendix --- Reflection {#appendix-reflection .unnumbered}

[\[Not required for CAS 741 ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

The purpose of reflection questions is to give you a chance to assess
your own learning and that of your group as a whole, and to find ways to
improve in the future. Reflection is an important part of the learning
process. Reflection is also an essential component of a successful
software development process.

Reflections are most interesting and useful when they're honest, even if
the stories they tell are imperfect. You will be marked based on your
depth of thought and analysis, and not based on the content of the
reflections themselves. Thus, for full marks we encourage you to answer
openly and honestly and to avoid simply writing "what you think the
evaluator wants to hear."

Please answer the following questions. Some questions can be answered on
the team level, but where appropriate, each team member should write
their own response:

1.  Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting
    the project?

2.  In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?

3.  What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?

### In Case of Emergency

If a team member has an emergency, team members will inform the rest of the team at their earliest 
convenience to ensure the other team members are aware that their responsibilities in the project
will be impacted. This applies to both attendance at team meetings and

In case of an emergency, a team member will:
1. Write a message in the project discord at their earliest convenience regarding what work will be missed, and during what time frame they may be unavailable.
2. Email team liaison Mitchell regarding the emergency to leave a record which can be shared with the course coordinators if necessary.

consequences for someone not contributing their fair share?
---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

[\[You may wish to use the project management metrics collected for the

[\[You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc. What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets? Do they need to bring
the coffee to the next team meeting? Does the team need to make an
appointment with their TA, or the instructor? Are there incentives for
reaching targets early? ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

### Team Building

We have been studying in the same program for nearly 5 years now, and so there are many shared
experiences which bring us together as a team. While it may not be necessary to schedule additional
activities for team building, it may prove beneficial for stress release and increasing team cohesion. 
- Team Lunches: Between classes, days when everyone is on campus and has time free around noon.
- Ad-hoc team activities: Other fun activities can be scheduled according to the free time of the team members


### Decision Making {#decision-making .unnumbered}

you handle disagreements? ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}
