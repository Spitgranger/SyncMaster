## Introductory Blurb 
This document outlines the development plan for the project. Further information regarding the problem is located in ~/docs/ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement.pdf.

# 1 Confidential Information?

This project will not contain extensive confidential information warranting a confidentiality agreement.
After a team meeting with MILO, it was determined our team will inform the City to advise us of any confidential information.
We will ensure it is not included in the source code or at the capstone expo.

# 2 IP to Protect

The project does not have any IP to protect.

# 3 Copyright License

What copyright license is your team adopting. Point to the license in
your repo.

# 4 Team Meeting Plan

## How often will you meet? where?
Weekly team meetings will occur on Monday evenings. Meetings to be held online or in-person depending on the groups preference that week.

## How often will you meet with your industry advisor? when? where?
We will meet with our industry advisor bi-weekly, but this could be more or less depending on the needs of the capstone team as we progress through the deliverables.
Meetings will be on Microsoft Teams, with the option to meet in-person if it is convenient for the particular meeting.
Meetings will be structured with a prepared agenda by the capstone team and the discussion with the stakeholder chaired by the team liaison. 
Meeting minutes and action items will be recorded by the capstone team.

# 5 Team Communication Plan

Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.

# 6 Team Member Roles

You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like
notetaker, leader, meeting chair, reviewer. Assigning specific people to
those roles is not necessary at this stage. In a student team the role
of the individuals will likely change throughout the year.


# 7 Workflow Plan

-   How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?

-   How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
    classification, etc.?

-   Use of CI/CD

# 8 Project Decomposition and Scheduling

-   How will you be using GitHub projects?

-   Include a link to your GitHub project

How will the project be scheduled? This is the big picture schedule,
not details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the
course outline for deadlines.

# 9 Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project? What
will you demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to
convince yourself that you will be able to overcome this risk?

# 10 Expected Technology

What programming language or languages do you expect to use? What
external libraries? What frameworks? What technologies. Are there major
components of the implementation that you expect you will implement,
despite the existence of libraries that provide the required
functionality. For projects with machine learning, will you use
pre-trained models, or be training your own model?

The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the
course of the project. The initial documentation should be written in an
abstract way; it should be agnostic of the implementation choices,
unless the implementation choices are project constraints. However,
recording our initial thoughts on implementation helps understand the
challenge level and feasibility of a project. It may also help with
early identification of areas where project members will need to augment
their training.

Topics to discuss include the following:

-   Specific programming language

-   Specific libraries

-   Pre-trained models

-   Specific linter tool (if appropriate)

-   Specific unit testing framework

-   Investigation of code coverage measuring tools

-   Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation
    that CI is not being done

-   Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if appropriate

-   Tools you will likely be using?

git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.

# 11 Coding Standard

What coding standard will you adopt?

# Appendix --- Reflection

The purpose of reflection questions is to give you a chance to assess
your own learning and that of your group as a whole, and to find ways to
improve in the future. Reflection is an important part of the learning
process. Reflection is also an essential component of a successful
software development process.

Reflections are most interesting and useful when they're honest, even if
the stories they tell are imperfect. You will be marked based on your
depth of thought and analysis, and not based on the content of the
reflections themselves. Thus, for full marks we encourage you to answer
openly and honestly and to avoid simply writing "what you think the
evaluator wants to hear."

Please answer the following questions. Some questions can be answered on
the team level, but where appropriate, each team member should write
their own response:

1.  Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting
    the project?

2.  In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?

3.  What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?

# Appendix --- Team Charter

Charter](https://engineering.up.edu/industry_partnerships/files/team-charter.pdf)

## External Goals
What are your team's external goals for this project? These are not
the goals related to the functionality or quality fo the project. These
are the goals on what the team wishes to achieve with the project.
Potential goals are to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have
something to talk about in interviews, or to get an A+, etc.

## Attendance

### Expectations

What are your team's expectations regarding meeting attendance (being
on time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?

### Acceptable Excuse

What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a
deadline? What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?

### In Case of Emergency 

What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and
cannot attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised
for a team deliverable?

## Accountability and Teamwork

### Quality

Each team member is expected to come prepared with the agreed upon meeting prerequisites. This includes any action items, questions, or code reviews. Each team member to is to put forth their best effort in the course and ask for help from their teammates or the instructional team if needed to meet the course deliverables at a high quality of work.

### Attitude

What are your team's expectations regarding team members' ideas,
interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else
regarding team member contributions? Do you want to introduce a code of
conduct? Do you want a conflict resolution plan? Can adopt existing
codes of conduct.

### Stay on Track

What methods will be used to keep the team on track? How will your
team ensure that members contribute as expected to the team and that the
team performs as expected? How will your team reward members who do well
and manage members whose performance is below expectations? What are the
consequences for someone not contributing their fair share?


You may wish to use the project management metrics collected for the
TA and instructor for this.

You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc. What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets? Do they need to bring
the coffee to the next team meeting? Does the team need to make an
appointment with their TA, or the instructor? Are there incentives for
reaching targets early?

### Team Building

How will you build team cohesion (fun time, group rituals, etc.)?

### Decision Making
To make decisions, the group member who's role is to direct that task will organize the rest of the group around their respective action items.
All team members will be able to contribute their opinion, and in general decisions will require a consensus amonngst the group.
If an issue is not resolved through discussion, it will be brought to the attention of the instructional team for mediation and feedback.
