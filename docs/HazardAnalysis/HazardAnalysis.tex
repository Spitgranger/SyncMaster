\section{Introduction}

Hazards can be defined as either a state of the system or an action
taken on the system, which causes system failures. System failures
include, but are not limited to, an inability of the system to
perform its required functions, loss of data, unauthorized access,
or harm to users.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

This document outlines a hazard analysis for SyncMaster, which is a system that
manages documentation and enables administrators to verify presence of users on
site. The purpose of this analysis is to identify and evaluate potential
hazards, outline how they will be detected/introduced to the system, and to
establish mitigation strategies. This analysis will also determine
the parties responsible
for each of the aforementioned points. Some of the losses that
may be incurred as a result of hazards are, but are not limited to:
financial loss, data loss, loss of trust, regulatory violations, and
operational interruption. These losses stemming from hazards must be mitigated
to ensure that the system operates securely, and in compliance with relevant
regulations.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
  You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel
  for the major
  ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will
  typically include
  each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a
  database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item There are trained, trusted employees with appropriate access
    in the system to resolve failures should they occur.
  \item There are workflows and processes in place to complete
    necessary tasks should the application fail.
  \item External libraries used are trustworthy, secure, and will not
    be a cause of failure.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of
this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
  The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You
  might trace to
  requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
  entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the
  capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
  \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
