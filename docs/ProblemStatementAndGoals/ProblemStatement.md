# Problem Statement

[\[You should check your problem statement with the [problem statement
checklist](https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf).

[\[You can change the section headings, as long as you include the
required information. ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

## Problem

## Inputs and Outputs

[\[Characterize the problem in terms of "high level" inputs and outputs.
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.

## Stakeholders

## Environment

# Goals

# Stretch Goals

# Challenge Level and Extras

[\[State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic). The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the
implementation or something else. Usually the greater the novelty of a
project the greater its challenge level. You should include your
rationale for the selected level. Approval of the level will be part of
the discussion with the instructor for approving the project. The
challenge level, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can
be modified over the course of the term. ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

[\[Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or
to make up for a less advanced challenge level. Potential extras include
usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof,
GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc. Normally the maximum number of
extras will be two. Approval of the extras will be part of the
discussion with the instructor for approving the project. The extras,
with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified over
the course of the term. ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

# Appendix - Reflection

1.  What went well while writing this deliverable?
* Sections were divided efficiently, and everyone was aligned on what was to be written and who would 
write each section.
* Ample time was given to complete the deliverable
* Multiple meetings were set to review work and hold accountability for work done
Everyone adhered to the self-imposed deadlines set for each section of the deliverable


2.  What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
* Some members had a better idea of the problem space, while others were more familiar with the 
development of software solutions. 
We overcame this by dividing members between this deliverable and the Development Plan.
* Version control does not allow live collaboration on written documents in the same way that google docs
 or microsoft word would. It was decided that the text for different section would be drafted on google 
 docs before being committed to github.

3.  How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but
    also of appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
