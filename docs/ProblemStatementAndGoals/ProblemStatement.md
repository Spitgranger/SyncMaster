# Problem Statement

## Background
Issuing and coordinating the work (work order tickets) to both internal staff and external contractors. The contractors will go perform the work and will have to go to the site and in order to be there, there is a number of preliminary documents and training that must be performed first. There is no way to quickly verify if a contractor has completed the plant H&S training. Facilities team is responsible for the contractor's health and safety, but currently it's the QA team managing this on their platform, and the facilities team doesn't have direct access to track this info.

If a new contractor is brand new, they must submit their WSIB and insurance certificates to the City. This must be kept on record. (expires and must be renewed periodically). Currently, it would just be up to the intelligence of the project manager to know if a certificate has expired, and ask for a new one. A system should help a human PM to manage this paperwork.

After their H&S training, each station has a station "hazard assessment" which must be signed and returned by the contractor. Currently there is abosultely no tracking system to see which employees in each contractors company has signed and returned these forms. Every station needs to have this form, and it should be very easy to distribute to anybody going this station as a health and safety measure. Updating, distributing, and seeing which employees have signed off on this form is all manual at the moment.

if a new piece of equipment is installed at a station (through work orders, or a contruction project) and this new piece of equipment has an operating manual, it needs a place to go to be stored and organized. And it also needs to be easy to distribute to anyone it would be relevant too. Problem: the sharing of information currently is very manual, full of outdated documents, and is a mess. that new equipment has a warranty with it, also needs to be stored and easily sent to anyone that needs it.

THere's new types of documents coming into existence all the time. Our system must be adaptable to now store a new category of document that might arise down the road are easy to add in to the system.

Question for the City: (note this will depend on the answer from MILO if we can go into the details on this). Brainstorm categories of documents that will be stored in the platform. We will want to have as comprehensive a list as we can, and sort through it as we build the requirements for the project).

Question for the City: what onboarding specific documents are there. Note: onboarding is tied to a specific contract. There will be tons of contract specific documentation that isn't part of a station per se, so won't be shared to other contractors or internal staff, but is very important to have on record for the facilities project manager to be able to view. There is currently no platform to manage this contract beyond a sharepoint folder.

The City of Hamilton has a problem managing their water and wastewater outstation facilities. There is currently no software platform which assists the facilities team to track the work that the team has to do.
This includes:


Currently the contractor H&S, they get a link to a training video, and they watch it and then they get put into the system once they sign off confirming they have watched the video. 

It is very easy to lose track of contract related deadlines on things needing signing, or otherpaperwork. 

Stretch goal/ expanding scope: Expand to be a facilities management platform for managing projects. New projects are always being made, and existing contracts last about 5 years and then are retendered. Would be good to have a system that tracks the history of previous contracts.

# Challenge Level and Extras

[\[State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic). The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the
implementation or something else. Usually the greater the novelty of a
project the greater its challenge level. You should include your
rationale for the selected level. Approval of the level will be part of
the discussion with the instructor for approving the project. The
challenge level, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can
be modified over the course of the term. ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

[\[Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or
to make up for a less advanced challenge level. Potential extras include
usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof,
GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc. Normally the maximum number of
extras will be two. Approval of the extras will be part of the
discussion with the instructor for approving the project. The extras,
with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified over
the course of the term. ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

# Appendix --- Reflection {#appendix-reflection .unnumbered}

[\[Not required for CAS 741 ---SS\]]{style="color: blue"}

The purpose of reflection questions is to give you a chance to assess
your own learning and that of your group as a whole, and to find ways to
improve in the future. Reflection is an important part of the learning
process. Reflection is also an essential component of a successful
software development process.

Reflections are most interesting and useful when they're honest, even if
the stories they tell are imperfect. You will be marked based on your
depth of thought and analysis, and not based on the content of the
reflections themselves. Thus, for full marks we encourage you to answer
openly and honestly and to avoid simply writing "what you think the
evaluator wants to hear."

Please answer the following questions. Some questions can be answered on
the team level, but where appropriate, each team member should write
their own response:

1.  What went well while writing this deliverable?

2.  What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?

3.  How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but
    also of appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
