\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The City of Hamilton's Water Division is responsible for the
treatment and distribution of drinking water and the collection and
treatment of wastewater throughout the City of Hamilton. Many pumping
stations are located throughout the City to perform this work. The
maintenance and upkeep of these facilities is crucial to ensure
unimpeded service. The facilties team at Hamilton Water requires an
application to assist in the management and security of these
stations, as there is not a robust system currently in place. For
detailed information on the problems the application should address,
refer to the problem statement
\href{https://github.com/Spitgranger/capstone/blob/main/docs/ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement.pdf}{here}.
\subsection{Goals of the Project}
The development of this application will greatly improve the
efficiency and transparency of facility management at Hamilton Water
and improve station security. For detailed information on the goals
of this project, refer to Section 2: Goals
\href{https://github.com/Spitgranger/capstone/blob/main/docs/ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement.pdf}{here}.
\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Matt Yakymyshyn (P.Eng)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Role: Senior Project Manager of Technical Services
      \item[-] Interest: Team leader for the facilities team within
        Technical Services who are the primary group responsible for
        maintaining facility infrastructure at pumping stations.
        Primary contact at the City for the capstone team.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Customer}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Technical Services team
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Role: Primary user within Hamilton Water
      \item[-] Interest: As the primary stakeholder, the requirements
        of this project are aimed at their specific needs. Their main concern
        is that station documentation is managed as a single source of truth,
        and is easily distributed/retrieved with relevant parties.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Other Stakeholders}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) team
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Role: Responsible for the control system controlling
        the treatment process.
      \item[-] Interest: The SCADA team also manages contractors and is
        interested in accessing and updating documentation maintained
        in this system.
      \item[-] They will have valuable input regarding existing City
        platforms and technologies, as well as how technology can be
        integrated into pumping stations.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Corporate Security

    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Role: Pumping Station Security
      \item[-] Interest: Provide feedback on any system involving station
        access.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Facilities project managers
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] The facilities project managers will be using the application
        daily to perform a variety of tasks. This includes verifying work was
        performed by contractors, accessing station documentation to share with
        contractors and internal staff, receiving signed forms and storing in a
        manner which is associated to the signee, and other tasks.
        They will have to be able to achieve all their needed requirements
        through the applications user interface, and will be a critical
        stakeholder to receive feedback from through user testing.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Facilities co-op students
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Facilities co-op students will be using the application to
        physically authenticate on site when performing inspections,
        scoping work, and verifying completion of work.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Facilities contractors
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Many contractors access pumping stations daily. They will
        interact with the application each time they perform facilities related
        work at the station. Interactions would include uploading and
        receiving documentation, and authenticating their presence on site
        to verify completion of work.
        Contractors come from a wide range of backgrounds depending on their
        trade, but are typically skilled workers in a particular field and are
        of working age (18 - 65 years old).
    \end{itemize}
  \item Facilities sub-contractors
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Many contractors employ sub-contractors as part of their work.
        While these subcontractors work for the contractor who hired them, they
        will still require access to the application to authenticate on site
        and access site information. Their roles and interactions
        will be similar to contractors, except they will be much less familiar
        with the application and may only use it for a short duration as they
        are not regular workers.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Personas}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Greg: A facilities manager
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Greg has a few tasks to complete this morning at work.
        He sees that another department has requested compliance documentation
        on crane inspections for the ministry, so he signs onto SyncMaster to
        retrieve the current version of these documents for each of these sites.
        While on the application, he receives a notification that a contractor
        he manages authenticated at site to complete a work order, but the
        application identified they had not completed their health and safety
        training. Greg prompts the system to issue this training to them, and
        runs a report on this contractor to see if any other employees of
        theirs require their training soon.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Nancy: A newly onboarded contractor
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Nancy is a plumber who is servicing her first work order after
        being hired by ``Worldly Plumbing''.
        Her company has notified her of the application she must use to
        authenticate for the work. When she authenticates, she is notified that
        the device she is servicing is located within a confined space
        and that she must sign and return a hazard assessment form and proof
        of confined space training.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Key users
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Facilities managers. They are the primary stakeholder of the
        application and it is intended to be a tool to greatly improve the
        efficiency of their work.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Secondary users
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Contractors. They will frequently use the system, but their
        needs are secondary to the key users.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{User Participation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Facilities managers will be frequently consulted throughout the
    duration of this project to demonstrate prototypes, receive feedback,
    and conduct user testing.
  \item Co-op students can also be consulted for user testing. They
    tend to have more availability for longer durations and will be
    able to provide insight into how a less experienced user
    interacts with the system.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
The facilities managers will be responsible for ensuring that day-to-day data
is added to the application appropriately. The team does not have a dedicated
software position, so maintainability of the technical aspects of the
application would need to be brought to the IT division of the City
when the project reaches that stage.

\section{Mandated Constraints}
\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{enumerate} [{C-SOL}1.]
  \item System must be cloud-based to fit in with current existing systems at
    the City of Hamilton.
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item There are over 100 pumping stations throughout the City.
  \item There are dozens of service contracts, and many contractors
    and staff accessing stations each day.
  \item Some stations are in remote locations and may have poor cell signal.
  \item Some properties have multiple stations at the same site.
  \item Certain stations have special entry procedures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Business Rules}
\begin{itemize}
  \item External contractors do not have access to the internal network.
  \item Only authorized users can approve new procedures.
  \item There is work at stations performed through a work order
    and routine work which doesn't have a work order.
  \item Employee collective agreements have restrictions on the release of
    GPS logs and video recording, which would require their approval.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Our project will focus on the application itself
    and our team will implement an authentication system adequate for our
    development. When the City integrates our application into their systems
    they would replace our authentication system with one that meets their
    detailed cybersecurity specifications.
  \item The existing entry and exit procedure for stations is not modified
    and our application will coexist with it.
  \item Existing City procedures will not change during the course of
    development.
  \item All external services are operating as expected.
\end{itemize}
\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
The process currently employed by the stakeholder is predominantly a manual one.
Currently, contractor management is a time-consuming and manual effort. The
following list identifies the current situation faced by the City:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To distribute new or revised documentation to contractors,
    the City sends the documents manually through email. There are no
    automated processes in place and this work flow is done manually
    for each document. There are dozens of contractors which these
    documents need to be distributed to, and those contractors
    themselves also change over time. The list of these contractors
    is also managed manually.
  \item Verification of work performed by contractors currently
    requires a physical visit to site. There is no automated process
    to collect information such as photos of the work performed,
    other than manually through email.
  \item It is currently difficult to know whether the labour cost
    billed by the contractors on their invoices is reflective of the
    actual work performed, as that information is only recorded in a
    physical logbook at each site and is not electronic. A contractor
    could overcharge for the work and it would be difficult to prove
    that their bill is inaccurate.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The below figure illustrates a high-level context model of the adjacent systems:

\subsection{Specifying a Business Use Case (BUC)}
The below points identify the business use cases for each of the
business events by number in section 6.3.\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Contractor authenticates themselves to City systems, proving that they
    are authorized to be provided City information.\\
  \item Contractor proves they are at a site for transparency when work is being
    completed.\\
  \item Staff authenticates themselves as authorized to view private data.\\
  \item Sign a document for contractual or regulatory purposes.\\
  \item Documents are stored for record keeping and relevant stakeholders
    are notified as necessary.\\
  \item Export data of a specific type specified by the user. For example, all
    crane inspections in the last year.\\
  \item View a procedure of how staff and contractors must access a specified
    station.\\
  \item New contractors are frequently onboarded, and their information is
    recorded by the facilities managers.\\
  \item Facilities managers commonly need to see which employees of a contractor
    are due for their health and safety training, WSIB expiry, etc.\\
  \item When a piece of documentation has expired, the next version needs to be
    put in place by staff to replace the expired version.\\

    \textcolor{red}{Removing as external access to City network is
    not possible.}
  \item The system should have 3 types of users: Contractor,
    Employee, and Admin.
    Only Admin users can change
    access permissions of other users and have read and write
    accesses to all documents in the system. Contractors and Employee
    users only have read access to documents. Employees have
    read-only access from the manager portal
    and can't view contractor logs. Contractor station access and
    file uploads are logged.
    See (1) in \textbf{Section 9.2 Formal Expressions}.
  \item The current site, work order number, job details, and entry/exit time of
    contractors should be visible to admin users in the system.
  \item The system should implement a form of geolocation verification before
    contractors are able to authenticate and upload documents. This
    must log when a contractor is on site. See (3) and
    (4) in \textbf{Section 9.2 Formal Expressions}.
  \item The system must notify users when a complicance document has expired.
    See (7) in \textbf{Section 9.2 Formal Expressions}.

\section{Open Issues}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The authentication methods for new users must meet security
    standards required for deployment. A feasible solution which
    falls within the scope of the project has yet to be determined.
  \item The security of the connection between the application and
    the city's resources must be at a certain standard to be
    deployed. The feasibility of reaching the required standards has
    yet to be determined.
  \item \sout{The feasibility of integrating the application with the City
      of Hamilton's current systems (e.g., MySDS, SharePoint) has yet
      to be determined. We require documentation and testing to assess
    compatibility.} \textcolor{red}{The SyncMaster Application will
      not directly connect to these existing
    City systems due to their proprietary nature and security concerns.}
  \item \sout{The feasibility of integration with upcoming systems, such as
      the work order tracking system in Infor EAM and security
      solutions, has yet to be determined. We require further
    information and documentation from the City.} \textcolor{red}{The
      SyncMaster application will not directly tie into the InforEAM system
      system as it is not yet deployed, is proprietary, and is outside
    of the core scope for this project.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
Currently there exist many document management systems (i.e. Google Docs,
Sharepoint). However, They miss some of the clients major requirements. The
city wants to be able to integrate with their work order management system to
show the status of a work order that is associated with any given document,
but existing solutions do not provide this capability. They also want to be
able to verify that people were at a given site, when completing work, which
again there isn't a ready made product to do.
\subsection{Reusable Components}
\sout{We can use Sharepoint as file storage, since the city wants
  Sharepoint and this
  system to be in sync, and storing the files in two seperate locations and then
  syncing them will introduce a lot of overhead. Instead, all files can just be
stored on Sharepoint.} \textcolor{red}{The City's internal Sharepoint
cannot be used as external actors are not permitted access.}
\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
N/A

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The application should recognize and interact with existing
    systems in a way that complements rather than competes with them.
    It should leverage existing data and processes instead of
    recreating or duplicating them.
    It should only introduce new workflows or tasks when no suitable
    existing solution is in place.
  \item If an existing business process can handle a particular task
    more effectively, the application should delegate that task
    rather than attempt to perform it redundantly.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The application should not change or interfere with the host
    system's configuration, performance, or files except for the
    necessary input and output operations.
  \item When interacting with other systems, the application should
    only retrieve necessary data and send data if required, but only
    as specified, without altering or influencing the external
    systems' operations or configurations.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The user may not have access to the internet.
  \item The user may not have a device which can run the application.
  \item The user may not be comfortable with giving the application
    permission to view their location.
  \item The user may not follow the intended flow for the system.
  \item The user may forget to logout or end their session when leaving site.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
N/A
\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Business processes might change, changing the requirements of
    the application.
  \item New software solutions may be introduced which make some
    features redundant.
  \item Regulations may change adding or removing requirements.
\end{enumerate}

Project deliverables should be completed by the deadlines given in
the course outline. GitHub will be used to track project milestones
and tasks. Tasks will be assigned to individual team members or to
groups. All work will be reviewed by other members of the team before
being committed to the project. Feedback received from stakeholders,
TAs, or the professor will be implemented in the project, and
requirements will be changed accordingly.
\begin{enumerate} [{Task }1.]
  \item Set-up codebase and begin development of project.
  \item Work on documentation and deliverables.
  \item Get feedback from stakeholders, TAs, and the professor and implement
    suggested changes.
  \item Work on the initial prototype emphasizing the functional
    requirements and prepare a meeting in January
    to demonstrate to the stakeholder for feedback.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Planning of the Development Phases}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Proof of Concept}: Will start development after
    October 9th, 2024. Aim to complete by November 4th.
  \item \textit{Rev. 0}: Aim to complete by February 6, 2024. The
    priority for this revision will be to implement FR1, FR3, and FR5.
  \item \textit{Rev. 1}: Aim to complete by March 30th, 2024. This
    revision will include the remaining functional requirements.
  \item \textit{Future revisions}: To be completed by the City of
    Hamilton by future manintainers. Includes MS-MTN5
    and multi-factor authentication.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
\begin{enumerate} [{MI-NP}1.]
  \item \sout{The system must be compatible with existing user roles in Active
      Directory.\\
      \textbf{Rationale}: Compatibility with existing business rules is needed
      to ensure migration can be completed in a short period of time without
    having to defined new roles.}
    \textcolor{red}{Removing requirement. SyncMaster Application will
    be standalone and not integrate into any existing systems.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
\begin{enumerate} [{MI-TR}1.]
  \item \sout{Information stored on paper must be digitized for
      consumption for the
      system.\\
      \textbf{Rationale}: Some content that the system is to consume has not yet
      been digitized. It will have to be digitized before the system is able to
    use it.}
    \textcolor{red}{Removing requirement. This would be the
      responsibility of the stakeholder to decide if it is necessary as
      an end user of the system and is not a responsibility of the
    development team.}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage{}
\section{Costs}
The cost for the application should not exceed \$750 unless approved
by the professor and the stakeholders for the project.\\
\\
It is expected that the team will spend 40 man-hours per week on the
project until its completion.\\
\\
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{3cm}p{2cm}X}
  \toprule {\textbf{Item}} & {\textbf{Cost}} & {\textbf{Description}}\\
  \midrule
  Cloud Services   & \$ 10     & Estimated Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  fees for 2 months of deployment\\
  Domain Name      & \$ 20     & Estimated cost of registering a top
  level domain for SyncMaster           \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\begin{enumerate} [{UDT-DR}1.]
  \item A user manual is required which outlines a procedure for the stakeholder
    use cases. This is needed for the facilities managers user group.
  \item A set-up manual specifying how both city employees and contractors
    can create an account in the system. This manual should include
    troubleshooting techniques for common problems.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Training Requirements}
\begin{enumerate} [{UDT-TR}1.]
  \item A training video will need to be recorded to demonstrate the
    functionality of the final product. In particular, it must show how each of
    the facilities managers use cases are performed. The training
    video must available to
    anyone the City feels would benefit from this training.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Waiting Room}
There are no more requirements that will be added to the system as of this
moment. This may change as the project evolves in the future.

\section{Ideas for Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Have QR codes available to users during entry to a site.
    These codes will direct new users to the portal. Once on the
    portal, email verification can be used to authenticate their
    identity. The name and email should match the City's contractor
    or employee records.
  \item Implement GPS functionality within the app to verify if users
    are physically present on-site when using the portal.
  \item Generate and provide new users with one-time passcodes to
    grant access to the portal and authenticate user identity.
  \item Use modular design that supports future integration with
    upcoming systems. Use dummy APIs to test the functionality.
\end{enumerate}

  \section*{Appendix --- Reflection}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\
      \\
      \textbf{Kyle} - For this deliverable we had worked on the
      document much earlier in advance of the deadline than we did for
      the problem statement and goals, which led to a higher quality of
      work. Also since we started earlier we had much less issues with
      merge conflicts than last time when we all started merging at
      about the same time.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Mitchell} - I think that our team improved upon our
      workflow from the first deliverable. The delegation of tasks and
      management of outstanding work in Github issues was executed by
      the team much more effectively.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Rafeed} - We decided to use LaTeX for this deliverable,
      which had a much better workflow, especially when it came time to
      do PRs and merges. The division of labour also worked out really
      well, with everyone doing their parts on time and with high
      quality. Kyle and Richard did a great job reviewing my PRs
      objectively, increasing the quality of work I submitted. \\
      \\
      \textbf{Richard} - I think our team did a good job in
      translating high level
      use cases and requirements from our stakeholders into system requirements
      that we can implement. Communication between our team and the stakeholders
      went smoothly which gave us ample time to elicit potential requirements.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Akshit} - I think our team did a fantastic job overall
      for this deliverable.
      The particular thing I liked was how we were able to brainstorm
      the together the requirements,
      constraints and potential problems for the project. All team
      members helped each other whenever
      required and as a result we were able to finish smoohtly with
      this deliverable.\\

    \item What pain points did you experience during this
      deliverable, and how did
      you resolve them? \\
      \\
      \textbf{Kyle} - Some of our team members had a better idea of the
      stakeholders and their current workplace environment whereas
      others had a better understanding of their vision for the project
      and their requirements. We resolved this by attempting to divide
      up work based on peoples strengths, while still adding everyone
      to PR's as reviewers so they could try to understand the sections
      that maybe weren't their strength or at least attempt to get a
      better understanding.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Mitchell} - Viewing the most up to date version of the
      pdf is difficult as commiting it to version control creates merge
      conflicts. Our team decided to work around this problem by not
      commiting the updated version of the pdf's in our branches, and
      commiting a final good version at the end of the deliverable.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Rafeed} - The workflow does not allow for live
      collaboration so it is difficult to get the input of other team
      members on the parts we are doing without them having to review
      your PRs, but everyone was very diligent with their reviews so
      there wasn't too long of a delay to get everyone's ideas
      together. We also had multiple meetings in-between to get
      everyone on the same page.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Richard} - The division of work was somewhat uneven for this
      deliverable. Some team members were more familiar with the stakeholder's
      business and use cases which led to them contributing more than others.
      This was mitigated through participation in document reviews and
      conversations with stakeholders so that the rest of the team could also
      learn more about the stakeholder and contribute more in the future.
      \\
      \textbf{Akshit} - I think one pain point that we experienced during this
      deliverable was setting up Latex locally on our machines.
      Sometimes, some team
      members received unexpected errors during compilation but this
      was easily overcome
      by asking help from the fellow members.\\
    \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
      client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders,
      potential users)? \\
      \\
      The vast majority of our requirements were informed by speaking
      to our clients or their proxies. Only really the look and feel,
      and performance requirements were not informed by direct
      discussion with the City. \\
    \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking,
      will help your team to be successful with your capstone project. \\
      \\
      \textbf{Kyle} - The requirements course (3RA3) will be very
      helpful because it taught us about requirements documents and how
      to elicit requirements. 3A04 will also be useful because it was
      the first course where we applied requirements documents to a
      project, and taught us about architecture styles for larger
      systems like the one we will make in this project. The software
      testing course (3S03) will be useful when it comes to creating
      test cases for this project and verifying the requirements. The
      human computer interfaces course (4HC3) that we are currently
      taking will help with informing decisions about the UI of our
      application and making sure to keep our clients in mind for all
      design decisions.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Mitchell} - The introduction to software development
      course (2AA4) will be useful as it serves as the basis for
      software design which we will use extensively throughout this project.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Rafeed} - 3A04 was good experience for working on
      large-scale development as a team. 3RA3 was useful in creating
      this document and eliciting requirements from the stakeholders.
      3S03 will be useful when creating a test plan. 4HC3 will be
      useful when designing an intuitive user-friendly interface. \\
      \\
      \textbf{Richard} - The former 3XA3 would help as it taught a lot about the
      software development process and has many deliverables that overlaped with
      the capstone course. For more specialized skills such as
      requirement writing
      and test plan writing, the skills learned from 3RA3 and 3S03 will be
      helpful.
      \\
      \textbf{Akshit} - The SE 3RA3 and 3A04 courses have been
      instrumental in my success
      so far in the course so far as they provided me hands on
      experience writing SRS
      documents. I also believe the experience from SE 2AA4 and 3BB4
      courses will help me during
      the implementation phase.\\
    \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to
      acquire to successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples
      of possible knowledge to acquire include domain specific
      knowledge from the domain of your application, or software
      engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or computer science
      knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing, or
      presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to
      identify at least one item for each team member. \\
      \\
      \textbf{Kyle} - Personally I have a lot of experience with using
      AWS and python, so the backend part of our tech stack is not much
      of a concern for me. However, I have limited experience with
      javascript or the NextJS framework that we plan on using, so I
      need to learn more about those.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Mitchell} - I have limited experience working in either
      frontend or backend design. I will have to work closely with my
      team members and the instructional team to develop these needed
      skills throughout the project. My strength is my project
      management experience and being a subject matter expert in the
      client's area of work (water and wastewater plant maintenance).\\
      \\
      \textbf{Rafeed} - I have experience with solution delivery and
      project management from my co-op. It may be useful in for this
      capstone project when generating new features, deciding to cut
      features, or if the project faces any roadblock. \\
      \\
      \textbf{Richard} - My skills are in systems programming and robotics, so
      most web technologies required for this project will be new to me. While I
      do have previous working with web technologies such as Node.Js and React,
      I will have to review these skills to refresh my understanding.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Akshit} - I have experience in both frontend and backend
      but I have not worked
      with cloud technologies in the past on a regular basis. Since we
      are planning to use AWS,
      I will have to learn it and I am looking forward to it. \\
    \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
      question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
      mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
      member pursue, and why did they make this choice? \\
      \\
      \textbf{Kyle} - In order to learn the javascript and NextJS I
      will watch videos online explaining them and how they work. I
      will also read the documentation for both and try using them in
      my spare time to get a better understanding of them.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Mitchell} - When we have decided on the specific
      technologies to use, I will follow the introductory tutorials
      provided by the creators of those software products. I will
      document my progress of this learning on Github. I will also
      discuss with my team members what tasks would be suitable for me
      to work on at my skill level, to help develop my skills while
      still contributing to the teams success. \\
      \\
      \textbf{Rafeed} - Learning the tech stack we will be using is
      crucial for providing value to this project. Two approaches to
      learning would be to read documentation, and watch guides. While
      I will be doing both, I will be mostly watching guides and
      following along, as I feel I learn the best this way. \\
      \\
      \textbf{Richard} - The best approach for me is to build. Hands
      on experience
      with the technology helps me learn pratical uses quickly. I also find that
      doing improves my research skills relating to that technology
      through reading
      the documentation.\\
      \\
      \textbf{Akshit} - I planning on watching tutorials on youtube
      related to AWS
      and also completing the basic certification course offered by
      Amazon. I also plan on building a
      small personal learning project on the side which uses AWS.\\
