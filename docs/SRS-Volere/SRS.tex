\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The City of Hamilton's Water Division is responsible for the
treatment and distribution of drinking water and the collection and
treatment of wastewater throughout the City of Hamilton. Many pumping
stations are located throughout the City to perform this work. The
maintenance and upkeep of these facilities is crucial to ensure
unimpeded service. The facilties team at Hamilton Water requires an
application to assist in the management and security of these
stations, as there is not a robust system currently in place. For
detailed information on the problems the application should address,
refer to the problem statement
\href{https://github.com/Spitgranger/capstone/blob/main/docs/ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement.pdf}{here}.
\subsection{Goals of the Project}
The development of this application will greatly improve the
efficiency and transparency of facility management at Hamilton Water
and improve station security. For detailed information on the goals
of this project, refer to Section 2: Goals
\href{https://github.com/Spitgranger/capstone/blob/main/docs/ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement.pdf}{here}.
\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Matt Yakymyshyn (P.Eng)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Role: Senior Project Manager of Technical Services
      \item[-] Interest: Team leader for the facilities team within
        Technical Services who are the primary group responsible for
        maintaining facility infrastructure at pumping stations.
        Primary contact at the City for the capstone team.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Customer}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Technical Services team
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Role: Primary user within Hamilton Water
      \item[-] Interest: As the primary stakeholder, the requirements
        of this project are aimed at their specific needs. Their main concern
        is that station documentation is managed as a single source of truth,
        and is easily distributed/retrieved with relevant parties.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Other Stakeholders}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) team
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Role: Responsible for the control system controlling
        the treatment process.
      \item[-] Interest: The SCADA team also manages contractors and is
        interested in accessing and updating documentation maintained
        in this system.
      \item[-] They will have valuable input regarding existing City
        platforms and technologies, as well as how technology can be
        integrated into pumping stations.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Corporate Security

    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Role: Pumping Station Security
      \item[-] Interest: Provide feedback on any system involving station
        access.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Facilities project managers
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] The facilities project managers will be using the application
        daily to perform a variety of tasks. This includes verifying work was
        performed by contractors, accessing station documentation to share with
        contractors and internal staff, receiving signed forms and storing in a
        manner which is associated to the signee, and other tasks.
        They will have to be able to achieve all their needed requirements
        through the applications user interface, and will be a critical
        stakeholder to receive feedback from through user testing.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Facilities co-op students
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Facilities co-op students will be using the application to
        physically authenticate on site when performing inspections,
        scoping work, and verifying completion of work.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Facilities contractors
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Many contractors access pumping stations daily. They will
        interact with the application each time they perform facilities related
        work at the station. Interactions would include uploading and
        receiving documentation, and authenticating their presence on site
        to verify completion of work.
        Contractors come from a wide range of backgrounds depending on their
        trade, but are typically skilled workers in a particular field and are
        of working age (18 - 65 years old).
    \end{itemize}
  \item Facilities sub-contractors
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Many contractors employ sub-contractors as part of their work.
        While these subcontractors work for the contractor who hired them, they
        will still require access to the application to authenticate on site
        and access site information. Their roles and interactions
        will be similar to contractors, except they will be much less familiar
        with the application and may only use it for a short duration as they
        are not regular workers.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Personas}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Greg: A facilities manager
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Greg has a few tasks to complete this morning at work.
        He sees that another department has requested compliance documentation
        on crane inspections for the ministry, so he signs onto SyncMaster to
        retrieve the current version of these documents for each of these sites.
        While on the application, he receives a notification that a contractor
        he manages authenticated at site to complete a work order, but the
        application identified they had not completed their health and safety
        training. Greg prompts the system to issue this training to them, and
        runs a report on this contractor to see if any other employees of
        theirs require their training soon.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Nancy: A newly onboarded contractor
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Nancy is a plumber who is servicing her first work order after
        being hired by ``Worldly Plumbing''.
        Her company has notified her of the application she must use to
        authenticate for the work. When she authenticates, she is notified that
        the device she is servicing is located within a confined space
        and that she must sign and return a hazard assessment form and proof
        of confined space training.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Key users
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Facilities managers. They are the primary stakeholder of the
        application and it is intended to be a tool to greatly improve the
        efficiency of their work.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Secondary users
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[-] Contractors. They will frequently use the system, but their
        needs are secondary to the key users.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{User Participation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Facilities managers will be frequently consulted throughout the
    duration of this project to demonstrate prototypes, receive feedback,
    and conduct user testing.
  \item Co-op students can also be consulted for user testing. They
    tend to have more availability for longer durations and will be
    able to provide insight into how a less experienced user
    interacts with the system.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
The facilities managers will be responsible for ensuring that day-to-day data
is added to the application appropriately. The team does not have a dedicated
software position, so maintainability of the technical aspects of the
application would need to be brought to the IT division of the City
when the project reaches that stage.

\section{Mandated Constraints}
\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{enumerate} [{C-SOL}1.]
  \item System must be cloud-based to fit in with current existing systems at
    the City of Hamilton.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item There are over 100 pumping stations throughout the City.
  \item There are dozens of service contracts, and many contractors
    and staff accessing stations each day.
  \item Some stations are in remote locations and may have poor cell signal.
  \item Some properties have multiple stations at the same site.
  \item Certain stations have special entry procedures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Business Rules}
\begin{itemize}
  \item External contractors do not have access to the internal network.
  \item Only authorized users can approve new procedures.
  \item There is work at stations performed through a work order
    and routine work which doesn't have a work order.
  \item Employee collective agreements have restrictions on the release of
    GPS logs and video recording, which would require their approval.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Our project will focus on the application itself
    and our team will implement an authentication system adequate for our
    development. When the City integrates our application into their systems
    they would replace our authentication system with one that meets their
    detailed cybersecurity specifications.
  \item The existing entry and exit procedure for stations is not modified
    and our application will coexist with it.
\end{itemize}
\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
The process currently employed by the stakeholder is predominantly a manual one.
Currently, contractor management is a time-consuming and manual effort. The
following list identifies the current situation faced by the City:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To distribute new or revised documentation to contractors,
    the City sends the documents manually through email. There are no
    automated processes in place and this work flow is done manually
    for each document. There are dozens of contractors which these
    documents need to be distributed to, and those contractors
    themselves also change over time. The list of these contractors
    is also managed manually.
  \item Verification of work performed by contractors currently
    requires a physical visit to site. There is no automated process
    to collect information such as photos of the work performed,
    other than manually through email.
  \item It is currently difficult to know whether the labour cost
    billed by the contractors on their invoices is reflective of the
    actual work performed, as that information is only recorded in a
    physical logbook at each site and is not electronic. A contractor
    could overcharge for the work and it would be difficult to prove
    that their bill is inaccurate.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The below figure illustrates a high-level context model of the adjacent systems:

business events by number in section 6.3.\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Contractor authenticates themselves to City systems, proving that they
    are authorized to be provided City information.\\
  \item Contractor proves they are at a site for transparency when work is being
    completed.\\
  \item Staff authenticates themselves as authorized to view private data.\\
  \item Sign a document for contractual or regulatory purposes.\\
  \item Documents are stored for record keeping and relevant stakeholders
    are notified as necessary.\\
  \item Export data of a specific type specified by the user. For example, all
    crane inspections in the last year.\\
  \item View a procedure of how staff and contractors must access a specified
    station.\\
  \item New contractors are frequently onboarded, and their information is
    recorded by the facilities managers.\\
  \item Facilities managers commonly need to see which employees of a contractor
    are due for their health and safety training, WSIB expiry, etc.\\
  \item When a piece of documentation has expired, the next version needs to be
    put in place by staff to replace the expired version.\\

    documents if the required training for the specific site is not complete.
    See (2) in \textbf{Section 9.2 Formal Expressions}.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Look and Feel Requirements}
\subsection{Appearance Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{LF-AP}1.]
  \item The colour palette of the application should align with other
    applications used by the city of Hamilton. \\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Aligning with the look of current
    applications at the city of Hamilton creates a consistent feel
    for current employees using the application.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Style Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{LF-ST}1.]
  \item The application should have a responsive design which
    considers different screen sizes and orientations. \\
    \textbf{Rationale}: The application may be used on a variety of
    different devices and therefore must be able to account for
    varying screen sizes and orientations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Usability and Humanity Requirements}
\subsection{Ease of Use Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-EU}1.]
  \item Users between the ages of {MIN\_AGE} and {MAX\_AGE},
    regardless of technical expertise, must be able to discover at least 70\% of
    the web application functionality within 10 minutes of being introduced to
    the system without any explaination or training.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Usability is of high importance to the users
    of the system. They will be mainly non-technical and must be able
    to learn and use the system quickly if it is to be of any value to them.
  \item The system should provide undo options or warnings for
    irreversible actions and 95\% of users should successfully use
    these features when prompted.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: It is important to provide users of the systems with
    confirmations or warnings to prevent errors and if they do happen, make it
    easy to recover from them.

\begin{enumerate}[{UH-LR}1.]
  \item Users between the ages of {MIN\_AGE} and {MAX\_AGE} should not take
    more than 10 minutes to a learn feature of the web application after it is
    discovered.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: A well designed system should give the user
    the most amount of functionality while being easy to understand.
    Users will be able to productive with the system in a short
    amount of time, reducing frustration.
  \item Users between the ages of {MIN\_AGE} and {MAX\_AGE} should be able to
    complete the system onboarding tutorial or walkthrough within 5 minutes,
    and 80\% of users should report feeling confident in using the
    system afterward.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: It is important that users are able to understand
    system documentation quickly to reduce mental overhead and increase
    productivity.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Understandability and Politeness Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-UP}1.]
  \item The application must not contain symbols or allusions that
    may be offensive or politically charged.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: As the system is to be used by people of
    diverse backgrounds and in a professional setting, it is
    important to keep a professional and neutural tone.
  \item System error messages should clearly explain the issue and
    suggest a resolution within 2 sentences. 90\% of users between
    the ages of {MIN\_AGE} and {MAX\_AGE} should report understanding
    the error and being able to resolve the issue without external support.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Useful system feedback is crucial since users need to
    know what the system is doing and how it interprets their input in order to
    determine next steps.

\section{Compliance Requirements}
\subsection{Legal Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[CR-L1] The application is to strictly abide by all regulations governing
    the treatment of water and wastewater. This includes, but is not limited
    to the \textit{Safe Drinking Water Act} (SDWA), 2002, the
    \textit{Ontario Water Resources Act} (OWRA), the
    \textit{Environmental Protection Act} and the \textit{Clean Water Act}.\\
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Standards Compliance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[CR-S1] Documentation which must be stored on the City's BCOS
    system are to be stored on the application in a manner which can
    transfer the data. Our application will align with the City's
    DWQMS (Drinking Water Quality Management System).\\
\end{itemize}

\section{Open Issues}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The authentication methods for new users must meet security
    standards required for deployment. A feasible solution which
    falls within the scope of the project has yet to be determined.
  \item The security of the connection between the application and
    the city's resources must be at a certain standard to be
    deployed. The feasibility of reaching the required standards has
    yet to be determined.
  \item The feasibility of integrating the application with the City
    of Hamilton's current systems (e.g., MySDS, SharePoint) has yet
    to be determined. We require documentation and testing to assess
    compatibility.
  \item The feasibility of integration with upcoming systems, such as
    the work order tracking system in Infor EAM and security
    solutions, has yet to be determined. We require further
    information and documentation from the City.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
Currently there exist many document management systems (i.e. Google Docs,
Sharepoint). However, They miss some of the clients major requirements. The
city wants to be able to integrate with their work order management system to
show the status of a work order that is associated with any given document,
but existing solutions do not provide this capability. They also want to be
able to verify that people were at a given site, when completing work, which
again there isn't a ready made product to do.
\subsection{Reusable Components}
We can use Sharepoint as file storage, since the city wants Sharepoint and this
system to be in sync, and storing the files in two seperate locations and then
syncing them will introduce a lot of overhead. Instead, all files can just be
stored on Sharepoint.
\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
N/A

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The application should recognize and interact with existing
    systems in a way that complements rather than competes with them.
    It should leverage existing data and processes instead of
    recreating or duplicating them.
    It should only introduce new workflows or tasks when no suitable
    existing solution is in place.
  \item If an existing business process can handle a particular task
    more effectively, the application should delegate that task
    rather than attempt to perform it redundantly.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The application should not change or interfere with the host
    system's configuration, performance, or files except for the
    necessary input and output operations.
  \item When interacting with other systems, the application should
    only retrieve necessary data and send data if required, but only
    as specified, without altering or influencing the external
    systems' operations or configurations.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The user may not have access to the internet.
  \item The user may not have a device which can run the application.
  \item The user may not be comfortable with giving the application
    permission to view their location.
  \item The user may not follow the intended flow for the system.
  \item The user may forget to logout or end their session when leaving site.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
N/A
\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Business processes might change, changing the requirements of
    the application.
  \item New software solutions may be introduced which make some
    features redundant.
  \item Regulations may change adding or removing requirements.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Tasks}
\subsection{Project Planning}
Project deliverables should be completed by the deadlines given in
the course outline. GitHub will be used to track project milestones
and tasks. Tasks will be assigned to individual team members or to
groups. All work will be reviewed by other members of the team before
being committed to the project. Feedback received from stakeholders,
TAs, or the professor will be implemented in the project, and
requirements will be changed accordingly.
\begin{enumerate} [{Task }1.]
  \item Set-up codebase and begin development of project.
  \item Work on documentation and deliverables.
  \item Get feedback from stakeholders, TAs, and the professor and implement
    suggested changes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Planning of the Development Phases}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Proof of Concept}: Will start development after
    October 9th, 2024. Aim to complete by November 4th.
  \item \textit{Rev. 0}: Aim to complete by February 1st, 2024.
  \item \textit{Rev. 1}: Aim to complete by March 30th, 2024.
  \item \textit{Future revisions}: TBD
\end{enumerate}

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
\begin{enumerate} [{MI-NP}1.]
  \item The system must be compatible with existing user roles in Active
    Directory.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Compatibility with existing business rules is needed
    to ensure migration can be completed in a short period of time without
    having to defined new roles.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
\begin{enumerate} [{MI-TR}1.]
  \item Information stored on paper must be digitized for consumption for the
    system.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Some content that the system is to consume has not yet
    been digitized. It will have to be digitized before the system is able to
    use it.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Costs}
The cost for the application should not exceed \$750 unless approved
by the professor and the stakeholders for the project.\\
\\
It is expected that the team will spend 40 man-hours per week on the
project until its completion.\\

\section{Ideas for Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Have QR codes available to users during entry to a site.
    These codes will direct new users to the portal. Once on the
    portal, email verification can be used to authenticate their
    identity. The name and email should match the City's contractor
    or employee records.
  \item Implement GPS functionality within the app to verify if users
    are physically present on-site when using the portal.
  \item Generate and provide new users with one-time passcodes to
    grant access to the portal and authenticate user identity.
  \item Use modular design that supports future integration with
    upcoming systems. Use dummy APIs to test the functionality.
\end{enumerate}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\
    \textbf{Kyle} - For this deliverable we had worked on the document much
    earlier in advance of the deadline than we did for the problem statement and
    goals, which led to a higher quality of work. Also since we started earlier
    we had much less issues with merge conflicts than last time when we all
    started merging at about the same time.
    \\
    \textbf{Rafeed} - We decided to use LaTeX for this deliverable, which had a much better workflow, especially when it came time to do PRs and merges. The division of labour also worked out really well, with everyone doing their parts on time and with high quality. Kyle and Richard did a great job reviewing my PRs objectively, increasing the quality of work I submitted.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did
    you resolve them? \\
    \textbf{Kyle} - Some of our team members had a better idea of the
    stakeholders and their current workplace environment whereas
    others had a better understanding of their vision for the project
    and their requirements. We resolved this by attempting to divide
    up work based on peoples strengths, while still adding everyone
    to PR's as reviewers so they could try to understand the sections
    that maybe weren't their strength or at least attempt to get a
    better understanding.
    \\
    \textbf{Rafeed} - The workflow does not allow for live collaboration so it is difficult to get the input of other team members on the parts we are doing without them having to review your PRs, but everyone was very diligent with their reviews so there wasn't too long of a delay to get everyone's ideas together. We also had multiple meetings in-between to get everyone on the same page.
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
    client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders,
    potential users)? \\
    \textbf{Kyle} - The vast majority of our requirements were
    informed by speaking to our clients or their proxies. Only really
    the look and feel, and performance requirements were not informed
    by direct discussion with the city.
    \\
    \textbf{Rafeed} - Meetings we had with the city were very useful for gathering information for this document. Nearly all of the parts I did were done with notes compiled from meetings we had with the primary stakeholders.
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
    your team to be successful with your capstone project. \\
    \textbf{Kyle} - The requirements course (SRA3) will be very
    helpful because it taught us about requirements documents and how
    to elicit requirements. 3A04 will also be useful because it was
    the first course where we applied requirements documents to a project, and
    taught us about architecture styles for larger systems like the
    one we will make in this project. The software testing course
    (3S03) will be useful when it comes to creating test cases for
    this project and verifying the requirements. The human computer
    interfaces course (4HC3) that we are currently taking will help
    with informing decisions about the UI of our application and
    making sure to keep our clients in mind for all design decisions.
    \\
    \textbf{Rafeed} - 3A04 was good experience for working on large-scale development as a team. 3RA3 was useful in creating this document and eliciting requirements from the stakeholders. 3S03 will be useful when creating a test plan. 4HC3 will be useful when designing an intuitive user-friendly interface.
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
    successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
    to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
    application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
    computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology,
    or writing, or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should
    look to identify at least one item for each team member. \\
    \textbf{Kyle} - Personally I have a lot of experience with using
    AWS and python, so the backend part of our tech stack is not much
    of a concern for me. However, I have limited experience with
    javascript or the NextJS framework that we plan on using, so I
    need to learn more about those.
    \\
    \textbf{Rafeed} - I have experience with solution delivery and project management from my co-op. It may be useful in for this capstone project when generating new features, deciding to cut features, or if the project faces any roadblock.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
    question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
    mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
    member pursue, and why did they make this choice? \\
    \textbf{Kyle} - In order to learn the javascript and NextJS I
    will watch videos online explaining them and how they work. I
    will also read the documentation for both and try using them in
    my spare time to get a better understanding of them.
    \\
    \textbf{Rafeed} - Learning the tech stack we will be using is crucial for providing value to this project. Two approaches to learning would be to read documentation, and watch guides. While I will be doing both, I will be mostly watching guides and following along, as I feel I learn the best this way.
\end{enumerate}
