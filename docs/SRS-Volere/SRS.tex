\end{itemize}

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item There are over 100 pumping stations throughout the City.
    \item There are dozens of service contracts, and many contractors
    and staff accessing stations each day.
    \item Some stations are in remote locations and may have poor cell signal.
    \item Some properties have multiple stations at the same site.
    \item Certain stations have special entry procedures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Business Rules}
\begin{itemize}
    \item External contractors do not have access to the internal network.
    \item Only authorized users can approve new procedures. 
    \item There is work at stations performed through a work order
    and routine work which doesn't have a work order.
    \item Employee collective agreements have restrictions on the release of
    GPS logs and video recording, which would require their approval.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our project will focus on the application itself
    and our team will implement an authentication system adequate for our
    development. When the City integrates our application into their systems 
    they would replace our authentication system with one that meets their 
    detailed cybersecurity specifications.
    \item The existing entry and exit procedure for stations is not modified
    and our application will coexist with it.
\end{itemize}
\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
The process currently employed by the stakeholder is predominantly a manual one.
Currently, contractor management is a time-consuming and manual effort. The 
following list identifies the current situation faced by the City:
\begin{itemize}
\item To distribute new or revised documentation to contractors, the City sends 
the documents manually through email. There are no automated processes in place
and this work flow is done manually for each document. There are dozens of
contractors which these documents need to be distributed to, and those
contractors themselves also change over time. The list of these contractors is
also managed manually.

\item Verification of work performed by contractors currently requires
a physical visit to site. There is no automated process to collect information 
such as photos of the work performed, other than manually through email.
\item It is currently difficult to know whether the labour cost
billed by the contractors on their invoices is reflective of the actual work
performed, as that information is only recorded in a physical logbook at each
site and is not electronic. A contractor could overcharge for the work and it
would be difficult to prove that their bill is inaccurate.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Context of the Work}

\section{Usability and Humanity Requirements}
\subsection{Ease of Use Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-EU}1.]
    \item Users between the ages of {MIN\_AGE} and {MAX\_AGE},
      regardless of technical expertise, must be able to discover at least 70\% of
      the web application functionality within 10 minutes of being introduced to
      the system without any explaination or training.\\
      \textbf{Rationale}: Usability is of high importance to the users of the system.
      They will be mainly non-technical and must be able to learn and use the
      system quickly if it is to be of any value to them.
    \item The system should provide undo options or warnings for irreversible actions
      and 95\% of users should successfully use these features when prompted.\\
      \textbf{Rationale}: It is important to provide users of the systems with
      confirmations or warnings to prevent errors and if they do happen, make it
      easy to recover from them.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Personalization and Internationalization Requirements}
N/A
\subsection{Learning Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-LR}1.]
    \item Users between the ages of {MIN\_AGE} and {MAX\_AGE} should not take
      more than 10 minutes to a learn feature of the web application after it is
      discovered.\\
      \textbf{Rationale}: A well designed system should give the user the most amount of
      functionality while being easy to understand. Users will be able to
      productive with the system in a short amount of time, reducing
      frustration.
    \item Users between the ages of {MIN\_AGE} and {MAX\_AGE} should be able to 
      complete the system onboarding tutorial or walkthrough within 5 minutes,
      and 80\% of users should report feeling confident in using the system afterward.\\
      \textbf{Rationale}: It is important that users are able to understand
      system documentation quickly to reduce mental overhead and increase
      productivity.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Understandability and Politeness Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-UP}1.]
    \item The application must not contain symbols or allusions that
      may be offensive or politically charged.\\
      \textbf{Rationale}: As the system is to be used by people of diverse backgrounds
      and in a professional setting, it is important to keep a professional and
      neutural tone.
    \item System error messages should clearly explain the issue and suggest a resolution
      within 2 sentences. 90\% of users between the ages of {MIN\_AGE} and {MAX\_AGE}
      should report understanding the error and being able to resolve the issue without
      external support.\\
      \textbf{Rationale}: Useful system feedback is crucial since users need to
      know what the system is doing and how it interprets their input in order to
      determine next steps.

\subsection{Maintenance Requirements}
\begin{enumerate} [{MS-MTN}1.]
  \item A deployment of the system should take no more than 30 minutes (not
  including testing, and building time).
  \item The build time of the system should be no longer than 10 minutes (not
  including testing time).
  \item All automated tests should be able to run in under 10 minutes
  \item The system should have rigourous unit testing, line coverage should be
  $\ge$ 95\%, branch coverage should be $\ge$ 90\%.
  \item All core functionalities of the system (i.e. Functional Requirements),
  should have both automated end-to-end and unit testing corresponding to them
  \item The project must be able to be maintained by its users, as original
  developers will not be maintaining it after April 2, 2025.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Supportability Requirements}
\begin{enumerate} [{MS-SUP}1.]
  \item The application should have user-facing documentation on how to use the
  core functionalities of the system (i.e. functionalities described in
  functional requirements).
  \item The application should have documentation for all API's for future
  maintainers.
  \item The application should have documentation of internal functions and 
  abstractions for future maintainers.
  \item The application should have documentation on deployment, so users can
  deploy this application for themselves.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Adaptability Requirements}
\begin{enumerate} [{MS-ADP}1.]
  \item The application must be able to run on at least Google Chrome and
  Microsoft Edge browsers.
  \item The application must be able to run on tablets, smartphones, and
  laptops.
  \item The application must be able to run on Android, IOS, and Windows 10

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
Currently there exist many document management systems (i.e. Google Docs,
Sharepoint). However, They miss some of the clients major requirements. The
city wants to be able to integrate with their work order management system to
show the status of a work order that is associated with any given document,
but existing solutions do not provide this capability. They also want to be
able to verify that people were at a given site, when completing work, which
again there isn't a ready made product to do.
\subsection{Reusable Components}
We can use Sharepoint as file storage, since the city wants Sharepoint and this
system to be in sync, and storing the files in two seperate locations and then
syncing them will introduce a lot of overhead. Instead, all files can just be
stored on Sharepoint.

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
\begin{enumerate} [{MI-NP}1.]
  \item The system must be compatible with existing user roles in Active
    Directory.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Compatibility with existing business rules is needed
    to ensure migration can be completed in a short period of time without
    having to defined new roles.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
\begin{enumerate} [{MI-TR}1.]
  \item Information stored on paper must be digitized for consumption for the
    system.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: Some content that the system is to consume has not yet
    been digitized. It will have to be digitized before the system is able to
    use it.
