\maketitle

\plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
  learning experience.  Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
  document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
  feedback.  Therefore, traceability between Revision 0 and Revision 1 is and
  important part of the reflection exercise.  In addition, several
  CEAB (Canadian
  Engineering Accreditation Board) Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be
  assessed based
on your reflections.}

\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}

\plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
  feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}

\plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight
  how the feedback
  from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should
  highlight the
supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}

\plt{Version control can make the summary relatively easy, if you used issues
  and meaningful commits.  If you feedback is in an issue, and you responded in
  the issue tracker, you can point to the issue as part of explaining your
  changes.  If addressing the issue required changes to code or
  documentation, you
  can point to the specific commit that made the changes.  Although
  the links are
  helpful for the details, you should include a label for each item
  of feedback so
  that the reader has an idea of what each item is about without the
  need to click
on everything to find out.}

\plt{If you were not organized with your commits, traceability between feedback
  and commits will not be feasible to capture after the fact.  You will instead
  need to spend time writing down a summary of the changes made in response to
each item of feedback.}

\plt{You should address EVERY item of feedback.  A table or itemized list is
  recommended.  You should record every item of feedback, along with
  the source of
  that feedback and the change you made in response to that feedback.  The
  response can be a change to your documentation, code, or development process.
  The response can also be the reason why no changes were made in
  response to the
  feedback.  To make this information manageable, you will record the
  feedback and
response separately for each deliverable in the sections that follow.}

\plt{If the feedback is general or incomplete, the TA (or instructor) will not
  be able to grade your response to feedback.  In that case your grade on this
  document, and likely the Revision 1 versions of the other documents will be
low.}

\subsection{Design and Design Documentation}

\subsection{VnV Plan and Report}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\subsection{Challenge Level}

\plt{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your
  project.  Your challenge level should exactly match what is included
  in your problem statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed
on between you and the course instructor.}

\subsection{Extras}

\plt{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
  can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
  proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.}

\section{Design Iteration (LO11 (PrototypeIterate))}

\plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
the design evolve from the first version to the final version?}

\plt{Don't just say what you changed, say why you changed it.  The needs of the
  client should be part of the explanation.  For example, if you made changes in
  response to usability testing, explain what the testing found and what changes
it led to.}

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
  assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?  Discuss each of these
separately.}

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

\plt{Is there a market for your product? What would be involved in
  marketing your
  product? What is your estimate of the cost to produce a version that you could
  sell?  What would you charge for your product?  How many units
  would you have to
  sell to make money? If your product isn't something that would be
  sold, like an
  open source project, how would you go about attracting users?  How
  many potential
users currently exist?}

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\plt{This question focuses on processes and tools used for project management.}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}

\plt{Did you follow your Development plan, with respect to the team
  meeting plan,
  team communication plan, team member roles and workflow plan.  Did you use the
technology you planned on using?}

\subsection{What Went Well?}

\plt{What went well for your project management in terms of processes and
technology?}

\subsection{What Went Wrong?}

\plt{What went wrong in terms of processes and technology?}

\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}

\plt{What will you do differently for your next project?}

\section{Reflection on Capstone}

\plt{This question focuses on what you learned during the course of
the capstone project.}

\subsection{Which Courses Were Relevant}

\plt{Which of the courses you have taken were relevant for the
capstone project?}

\subsection{Knowledge/Skills Outside of Courses}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Needed to learn how to develop an AWS
    application (both forntend and backend) and about the various AWS
    services that exist. Some of us had experience with this from
    co-ops, but others didn't.
  \item Next.js - Needed to learn how to create a frontend application using
    the Next.js framework. Some of us had experience with this from
    co-ops, but others didn't.
  \item GitHub Actions - Needed to learn how to create github actions
    workflows for linting, building, testing, deploying, etc. Some of
    us had experience with this from co-ops, but others didn't.
  \item GitHub Issues - Needed to learn how to use GitHub issues to
    effectively track work done. Some of us had experience with this
    from co-ops, using similar applications like Jira, but others didn't.
  \item Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Needed to learn how to write SAM
    (Serverless Application Model) and CFN (CloudFormation) templates to
    make AWS deployment easy and replicable. Some of us had
    experience with this from co-ops, but others didn't.
  \item City of Hamilton Water Division - Needed to understand the
    processes of the City of Hamilton Water Division to create
    project requirements and effectively come to a solution. Mitchell
    had some knowledge of these processes from his co-op, but others didn't.
